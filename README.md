# MP_DS_Simulation

This is a repository of the Simulation team for the Master Project Distributed System project. 
The goal of the project is to simulate a workflow execution with a Nextflow framework. 

Please also check the MPDS_Simulation_Final_Report.pdf for more information.

## Structure
In this repo you can find all the neccessary steps to simulate the workflow, please see the following architecture:
![project architecture](https://github.com/sopa40/MP_DS_Simulation/blob/main/NewSchematic.png)

# Steps (1), (2), (3)
Preparation steps for the simulation, please check /JSONGenerator for more details.

# Step (4) 
The simulation itself can be performed using /nf-wrench-sim folder, which already contains all prepared input for running the simulation, so might be executed independently from doing previous steps. Please see corresponding Readme for more information.
